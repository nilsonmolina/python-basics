# pylint: disable=C0103
# - [C0103] is a warning for naming constants with UPPER_CASE convention.
#   When checking names, Pylint differentiates between constants, variables,
#   classes etc. Any name that is NOT inside a function/class will be
#   considered a constant, anything else is a variable.
